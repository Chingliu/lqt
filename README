lqt is an in-development Qt binding for Lua.

You can find information about Qt at Trolltech
(http://trolltech.org) and about Lua on its site
http://lua.org

This software is still in very early development
and must not be used in production environment.
In any case you use it at your own risk.

The latest version can be found at the main Git
repository http://repo.or.cz/w/lqt.git

The version on the KDE repository is less likely
to be up to date with the Git one unless/until
I find a clean way to push changes directly to
svn. Pointers to tutorials and manuals are
welcome.

The BUILD file gives some information on how to
build the bindings.

lqt builds the bindings using the information
found in the Qt headers. The generator itself
does not link ti Qt at all and is under the
MIT/BSD license included in the file named
LICENSE. The generated files most likely fall
under the same license as your Qt copy.
I am no lawyer, however, so contact Trolltech
for more details on their license.
